## Command Completion

Use the vault command to install command-line completions like this.

```shell
vault -autocomplete-install
```

Once you have installed the completions, you should restart your terminal session or reload the shell to begin using them.

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

# Starting the Server

First, start a Vault dev server. The dev server is a built-in, pre-configured server that is not very secure but useful for playing with Vault locally.

```shell
vault server -dev
```

Now that we start the dev server, launch a new terminal session.

```shell
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
```

Save the unseal key somewhere. Don't worry about how to save this securely. For now, just save it anywhere.

```shell
export VAULT_TOKEN="<YOUR ROOT TOKEN HERE>"
```

Now we need to verify the Server is Running

```shell
$ vault status

Key             Value
---             -----
Seal Type       shamir
Initialized     true
Sealed          false
Total Shares    1
Threshold       1
Version         1.5.0
Cluster Name    vault-cluster-4d862b44
Cluster ID      92143a5a-0566-be89-f229-5a9f9c47fb1a
HA Enabled      false
```

**Warning**

Do not run dev server in **production!**

# [Writing a Secret](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/getting-started-first-secret?in=vault/getting-started#writing-a-secret)

Let's start by writing a secret. This is done very simply with the `vault kv` command, as shown below:

```shell
$ vault kv put secret/hello foo=world

Key              Value
---              -----
created_time     2019-02-04T19:53:22.730733Z
deletion_time    n/a
destroyed        false
version          1
```

This writes the pair `foo=world` to the path `secret/hello`!

You can even write multiple pieces of data, as shown below:

```shell
$ vault kv put secret/hello foo=world excited=yes

Key              Value
---              -----
created_time     2019-02-04T19:54:03.250328Z
deletion_time    n/a
destroyed        false
version          2
```

**Warning**

The examples in this guide use the `<key>=<value>` input to send secrets to Vault. However, sending data as a part of the CLI command often end up in the **shell history unencrypted**. To avoid this, refer to the documentation or [Static Secrets: Key/Value Secrets Engine guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/static-secrets#q-how-do-i-enter-my-secrets-without-exposing-the-secret-in-my-shell-s-history) to learn different approaches.
