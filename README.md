## Command Completion

Use the vault command to install command-line completions like this.

```shell
vault -autocomplete-install
```

Once you have installed the completions, you should restart your terminal session or reload the shell to begin using them.

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

# Starting the Server

First, start a Vault dev server. The dev server is a built-in, pre-configured server that is not very secure but useful for playing with Vault locally.

```shell
vault server -dev
```

Now that we start the dev server, launch a new terminal session.

```shell
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
```

Save the unseal key somewhere. Don't worry about how to save this securely. For now, just save it anywhere.

```shell
export VAULT_TOKEN="<YOUR ROOT TOKEN HERE>"
```

Now we need to verify the Server is Running

```shell
$ vault status

Key             Value
---             -----
Seal Type       shamir
Initialized     true
Sealed          false
